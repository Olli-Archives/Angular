# Angular CLI
Angular CLI is used to help in creating projects and preventing from having to recreate a bunch of boiler plate code.

## Install the Angular CLI
You want to install the CLI globally so that it is accessible in all directories.  To do this in the terminal execute the following command.
```
npm i @angular/cli -g
```

## Start a project
the angular CLI is invoked through the command line using the acronym ng.  To create a new project in the terminal
```
ng new name-of-your-project
```

Now that you have a bare bones project, you can cd into the directory and run it on localhost with the following terminal command
```
ng serve
```
From here you will geta dialogue box that gives you the local host address that you can visit in the browser to see your application live.
